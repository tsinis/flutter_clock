# Vector Assets used in Steampunk Flutter Clock.

All those vector assets were exclusively made and optimized, for being used in [Rive](https://rive.app) (ex Flare) animations, with free online tools.
> **Note:** at this moment (January 2020) there is still some problems with importing SVG designs in Rive, so there is no radial gradients used at all and linear gradients are reduced to necessary minimum.

Assets are made in free to use online editor called [Gravit Designer](https://www.designer.io/) (you don't need "Pro" features for it), then exported to SVG without background. After that, SVG files were optimized (to reduce the file size) and imported into the Rive. *Due to technical reasons, I did not used all assets, in final animation file.*
