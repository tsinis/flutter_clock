# Steampunk Clock for Flutter Clock contest

This project is **one of the winning submissions** in **Google & Lenovo** dev/design contest, called "***Flutter Clock***" (with **over 850** valid entries from around the world). You can read more about this contest here: [flutter.dev/clock](https://flutter.dev/clock).

I've made a analog clock variant, with look and feel of, late 18 or early 19 century. This is mainly design contest, so, there is **a lot of details and animations inside**, made with [Rive](https://rive.app) (ex Flare) tool.
> **Note:** design is screen size independent, because all the graphics is made in vectors (not bitmaps), but I have prepared it with 4-6' screen size in mind (so as big as Lenovo's Smart Clock display).

It has a light theme and a dark theme, **cuckoo bird, four easter eggs** and displays sample weather and temperature data, provided from Flutter Clock Helper package. App works on all platforms that Flutter offers and fully covered with tests. You can watch a **preview video of it (with main functionality highlight) here:**
