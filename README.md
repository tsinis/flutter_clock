# Steampunk Clock for Flutter Clock contest

This app is made in Flutter framework, for Google's & Lenovo dev/design contest, called "***Flutter Clock***", you can read more about this contest here: [flutter.dev/clock](https://flutter.dev/clock)

------

I've made a analog clock variant, with look and feel of, late 18 or early 19 century. This is mainly design contest, so, there is **a lot of details and animations inside**, made with [Rive](https://rive.app) (ex Flare) tool.
> **Note:** design is screen size independent, because all the graphics is made in vectors (not bitmaps), but I have prepared it with 4-6' screen size in mind (so as big as Lenovo's Smart Clock display).

It has a light theme and a dark theme, **cuckoo bird** and displays sample weather and temperature data, provided from Flutter Clock Helper package. You can watch a **preview video of it (with main functionality highlight) here:**

Also you can see something more about it, in my blog (link will be provided later), “How it’s made” video of animation preparing (all assets and app itself, are made with free online tools) can be found here:
